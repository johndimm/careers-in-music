Careers in Music

I want to use the musicbrainz api as a way to navigate a spotify client.

Given an album title and artist, 

  - display a link to spotify
  - list all the musicians on the album
  - find the album each member did before and after
  - display spotify links to the previous album in the left margin
  - display links to the next album in the right margin
  - display album covers when possible
  - display musician photos when possible

Musicbrainz API is here:
